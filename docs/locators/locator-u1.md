## Dscription

The Locator-U1 is a battery powered, digital hydro acoustic locator device including a depth sensor. The Locator has 3 mounting holes on each side for M3 screws. A default bracket is included. The internal battery is rechargeable using a USB-C charger (included). Fully charged, the U1 will be operational for approximately 6 hours. Before deployment in water, the Locator-U1 needs to achieve a GPS lock. The integrated status-LED shows the condition of the GPS lock. 

## Benefits

* Battery powered operation removes all cable requirements enabling easy operation.

* Extremely small size making it perfect for on-body applications like diving.

* Highly robust operation in areas with reflections (shallow water, around installations etc.)

## Wiring interface

Because the U1 is battery powered the only interface for it is the charing port which is a standard USB-C type connector.
