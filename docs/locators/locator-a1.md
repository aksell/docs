# Locator-A1

## Description

The Locator-A1 is an analog hydro acoustic locator device. The A1 has the smallest physical ootprint in our series of locators, and can be integrated into even the most compact ROV system. The Locator-A1 does not carry its own depth sensor. In an Underwater GPS system, the Master-D1 will require the depth to be provided from the underwater vehicle (ROV etc.) using the Master-D1  software API. The electrical interface complies with the Water Linked A1 communication standard. 

## Benefits

* Extremely small footprint enabling easy integration in other equipment.

* Highly robust operation in areas with reflections (shallow water, around installations etc.)

## Wiring interface

The tables below shows the pinning of the A1 interface connectors.
