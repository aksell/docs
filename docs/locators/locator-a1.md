# Locator-A1

## Description

The Locator-A1 has the smallest physical footprint in our series of locators. It can be integrated into even the most compact ROVs. The Locator-A1 does not carry its own depth sensor so the Master-D1 requires the depth to be provided from your underwater vehicle (ROV etc.) This is acheived by using the included software API.  Example of how to perform this can be found [here](https://waterlinked.github.io/docs/explorer-kit/gui/api/).

## Benefits

* Extremely small footprint enabling easy integration in other equipment.

* Highly robust operation in areas with reflections (shallow water, around installations etc.)
