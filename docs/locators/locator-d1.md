# Locator-D1

## Description

The Locator-D1 is a digital hydro acoustic locator device including a depth sensor. The depth data is available through the D1 interface, and makes it well suited for retrofitted and stand-alone applications. The electrical interface complies with the Water Linked D1 communication standard. The Locator performs a chain of advanced digital signal processing operations before transmitting an acoustic wave.

## Benefits

* Extremely small footprint enabling easy integration in other equipment.

* No requirements to integrate depth and power from external systems.

* Highly robust operation in areas with reflections (shallow water, around installations etc.)

## Wiring interface
